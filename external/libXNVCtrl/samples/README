NV-CONTROL X Extension Samples

The `nvidia-settings` application is fairly involved, and is not
the easiest source code to read through for someone interested in
learning how to use the NV-CONTROL X extension.

The applications in this directory are trivial examples demonstrating
how to use the NV-CONTROL X extension.  For more thorough
documentation on the extension, please see the NV-CONTROL-API.txt
document (located in the doc/ directory of the nvidia-settings
source package).

Sample applications:

    nv-control-info:      Demonstrates how to query for extension
                          presence and basic information.

    nv-control-dvc:       Demonstrates how to query and assign an
                          integer attribute (NV_CTRL_DIGITAL_VIBRANCE); also
                          shows how to handle multiple display devices.

    nv-control-events:    Demonstrates how to register to receive and
                          interpret NV-CONTROL events.

    nv-control-dpy:       Demonstrates how to configure display devices
                          using the NV-CONTROL X extension.

    nv-control-targets:   Demonstrates how to query various attributes
                          from varying target types (GPUs, X Screens,
                          Frame Lock Boards) using the XNVCTRL target
                          functions.

    nv-control-framelock: Demonstrates how to query frame lock related
                          attributes.  Also demonstrates how to enable/
                          disable frame lock.

    nv-control-gvi:       Demonstrates how to interact with the Graphics-to-
                          Video-In (GVI) capabilities of a GVI target via
                          NV-CONTROL.
